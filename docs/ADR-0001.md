# ADR-0001: Initial Architecture Decisions

Date: 2024-01-16
Status: Accepted

## Context

Creating a minimal yet production-grade Vue 3 PWA skeleton that meets strict requirements for installability, offline functionality, and quality thresholds while maintaining simplicity and maintainability.

## Decisions

### 1. PWA Implementation: Vite Plugin PWA with Workbox

**Choice:** `vite-plugin-pwa` with Workbox strategies

**Rationale:**

- Seamless integration with Vite build process
- Workbox provides battle-tested caching strategies
- Auto-generates service worker with minimal configuration
- Supports auto-update pattern out of the box

**Trade-offs:**

- Additional build dependency
- Less control than hand-written service worker
- Bundle size includes Workbox runtime (~15KB gzipped)

**Alternatives considered:**

- Manual service worker: More control but more maintenance burden
- PWA libraries (e.g., @vueuse/pwa): Less mature ecosystem

### 2. Testing Framework: Vitest + Playwright

**Choice:**

- Unit tests: Vitest with @vue/test-utils
- E2E tests: Playwright

**Rationale:**

- Vitest: Native Vite integration, fast execution, Jest-compatible API
- Playwright: Best-in-class network emulation for offline testing
- Both support TypeScript natively

**Trade-offs:**

- Two different test runners to maintain
- Playwright requires browser downloads
- Learning curve for teams familiar with Jest/Cypress

**Alternatives considered:**

- Jest: Slower, requires additional configuration for Vite
- Cypress: Weaker offline testing capabilities
- WebdriverIO: More complex setup

### 3. CI/CD: GitHub Actions with pnpm

**Choice:** Single workflow with pnpm package manager

**Rationale:**

- GitHub Actions: Native to repository, free for public repos
- pnpm: Faster installations, strict dependency resolution, disk space efficient
- Single workflow: Simpler to maintain, ensures all checks pass together

**Trade-offs:**

- Vendor lock-in to GitHub
- pnpm may have compatibility issues with some packages
- Single workflow means longer feedback time

**Alternatives considered:**

- npm/yarn: More widely supported but slower
- Multiple workflows: More granular but complex
- CircleCI/Jenkins: Additional service dependency

### 4. Linting/Formatting: ESLint 9 + Prettier

**Choice:** Flat config with ESLint 9, separate Prettier

**Rationale:**

- ESLint 9: Modern flat config is simpler and more maintainable
- Separate Prettier: Clear separation of concerns
- Vue/TypeScript plugins: Official support and community standards

**Trade-offs:**

- Two tools to configure and run
- Potential conflicts between rules
- ESLint 9 flat config is newer, less documentation

**Alternatives considered:**

- ESLint-only formatting: Less consistent results
- Biome: Newer, less mature ecosystem
- Standard.js: Too opinionated for general use

### 5. Caching Strategy: App-Shell Pattern

**Choice:** Cache-first for app shell, network-first for dynamic content

**Rationale:**

- Instant loading for repeat visits
- Reliable offline experience
- Clear separation between static shell and dynamic content

**Trade-offs:**

- Requires cache invalidation strategy
- Users may see stale content initially
- Additional complexity in service worker configuration

**Future considerations:**

- Implement versioning strategy for cache busting
- Add runtime caching for API calls
- Consider cache-then-network for better UX

## Future Considerations

1. **State Management:** When needed, consider Pinia for Vue 3 ecosystem alignment
2. **API Integration:** Add runtime caching strategies for backend calls
3. **Authentication:** Implement secure token storage and refresh patterns
4. **Monitoring:** Add error tracking (Sentry) and analytics when required
5. **i18n:** Vue I18n when internationalization becomes necessary
6. **Component Library:** Evaluate needs before adding UI framework
7. **Performance:** Consider code splitting for routes as app grows
8. **Cache Strategies:** Revisit based on real-world usage patterns

## Consequences

### Positive

- Minimal dependencies reduce attack surface and maintenance burden
- Standard Vue 3 patterns ensure broad developer familiarity
- Strong typing with TypeScript catches errors early
- Comprehensive testing ensures reliability
- PWA features provide native-like experience

### Negative

- No UI components require custom implementation
- No state management limits complex data flows initially
- Single route means router overhead for simple app
- Build complexity from multiple tools (Vite, Workbox, TypeScript)

### Neutral

- Opinionated setup may not fit all use cases
- Focus on simplicity may require refactoring for complex features
- Desktop-first Lighthouse configuration may need mobile adjustments
